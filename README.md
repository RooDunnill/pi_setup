These are come files to try to make the setup of my pis faster, atm installing eduroam is a pain and I can't do anything without wifi, so hopefully this streamlines the process
Clone the repo outside of the boot and then copy and paste the files into the boot partition, also make sure to change your eduroam username and password accordingly
